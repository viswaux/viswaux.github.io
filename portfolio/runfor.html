               Our clients, runcolfax.org, conducts a walking/running event series that enables participants to crowd-fund for local renewable energy projects.</b>
           </p>
           <p>
               Organizing a race is not an easy task, and there were many individuals out there that either couldn’t make it to the annual race event.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>The proposal was to merge two domains:</b> activity tracking and crowd funding. Users would download the app and passively fundraise for renewable energy projects in the lower mainland. They would do this by asking for one-time donations or pledges on a $/mile basis. By committing to a healthier lifestyle users are able to make a positive impact on their community at large.
           </p>

              <h3 class="uppercase"><b>Process</b></h3>
              <h5>User Survey &amp; User Interviews</h5>
              <p>
                 We interviewed 6 individuals that fit the criteria and captured our findings. As we analyzed our data after our survey, we collected about 40 responses, but realized that our demographic was limited to individuals between 18–34, and we needed responses for users between 35–46 as well. We extended our reach by short-listing primarily those that were married, or those that had families, to find users in the age gap and concluded our survey with roughly 65 responses.
             </p>
             <figure>
               <img class="img-thumbnail headroom-xs legroom-xs" src="../images/runfor/survey.png" alt="Demographic information" style=" display: block; margin: auto;margin-bottom: 1.5%;">
               <figcaption class="caption">Demographic information</figcaption>
             </figure>
             <p>
                 We took all the data collected from our survey and interviews through an affinity sort to organize our data sets. There are several points that stand out:

                   <ul>
                     <li>Socially conscious individuals want to know the impact that they are having, more so than the total monetary contributions that have been gathered.
                     <li>Users all say that they are skeptic of where their money is going towards, and are motivated to fundraise if they know where the money is going towards.</li>
                     <li>Users are overwhelmingly uncomfortable with asking people and friends for money, and those that are comfortable do so over social media.</li>
                   </ul>
             </p>

             <hr><br>
             <h5>User Persona</h5>
             <p>
               From our affinity diagram earlier, we constructed our primary user persona — meet Maurice:
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img class="img-thumbnail headroom-xs legroom-xs" src="../images/runfor/persona.png" alt="Primary persona" style=" display: block; margin: auto;margin-bottom: 1.5%;">
              <figcaption class="caption">Primary persona</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <hr><br>
            <h5>Design</h5>
            <p>
              When we first spoke with the client, they had expressed that they had future plans to expand the platform to be used by multiple non-profits for raising money. This thought was factored into the decisions driving the information architecture of site.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the final design the health kit on iOS devices is where the activity tracking information is pulled from. By allowing the health kit to work in the background the user will passively work towards their goal without having to remind themselves to keep track. Since the app is optimized for iOS this was a natural fit.

            </p>
            <p>
              Each button on the universal navigation bar at the bottom is designed to match the goals of the business to user wants.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img class="img-thumbnail headroom-xs legroom-xs" src="../images/runfor/navbar.png" alt="critter" style=" display: block; margin: auto;margin-bottom: 1.5%;">
              <figcaption class="caption" >Universal bottom navigation bar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              <strong>Activity</strong> —aligned user goals with showing evident impact they are making while encouraging the business goals of motivating users to raise more money.&nbsp;<br>
              <strong>Teams</strong> — data from the surveys showed that fundraisers are likely to involve their personal networks and often times are more comfortable being vocal about their fundraising efforts if in a dynamic. This contributes once again to the primary business goal of raising money for clean energy projects.&nbsp;<br>
              <strong >Causes</strong> — this button is a great infomation source meant to educate fundraisers on the projects they are contributing to as well as a quick guide to help them educate others including potential donors. This is a helpful way to increase education.<br>
              <strong >Pledges</strong> — this button gives a quick overview of where the user is at in their process as well as an easy place to start the donation process.&nbsp;<br>
              <strong >Share</strong> — since users and the businesses mutually benefit from talking about their successes

            <hr><br>
            <h5>User Testing</h5>
            <p>Testing revealed some key insights that helped shape the next iterations and ultimately the final prototype. Initial tests proved that some naming conventions could alter to be more relatable ie. “campaigns” to “causes” — users found that campaigns was not straightforward enough where causes resonated with the function and seemed friendlier to users.It also revealed that an onboarding process for first time users would be very helpful.</p>

          </div>
        <hr><br>
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>I felt that our final product aligned with client's business goals with the user goals. This project had a great deal of research effort put in, and we truly understood the users that would be working with this app. There are some technical considerations — the app would leverage the Apple Health data, as opposed to building in additional fitness tracking abilities, and there are other features that we could envision being incorporated in a future build, such as incentivization, chat for users, a platform to support additional causes, and a point-of-interest map. Overall, this project was a challenging but rewarding experience, and has helped me tremendously in understanding how to best function in a team of designers.</p>
